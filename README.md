Album Database Web App

This app is a basic app that allows users to keep a database of any albums they have or may like.  It includes fields for title, artist, release date, genre, and even if it has the Parental Guidance label.

To start the application, download it, build it, then click on the IIS express button in Visual Studio.  The project requires .NET Core SDK version 1.0.0-preview2-003133 (.NET Core 1.0.1).  If there is an issue with the database, a rebuild of the project should clear it up.

The first page that loads gives instructions on how to access the app.  Also, please ignore the register and log in buttons on top as they do not function and will be eliminated in a further release.
